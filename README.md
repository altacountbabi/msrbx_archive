# MS Store Roblox archive

Just an archive of old roblox versions from the ms store.

Sadly I cant upload the whole bundle, I instead used 2 chunks for every version so that they are under github's file size limit. You can combine 2 chunks with this command in cmd:

```bash
COPY /B path/to/chunk0 + path/to/chunk1 output.Msixbundle
```

This repo will be updated with every new roblox version that comes out.
